## Key Skills

* [Model validation and protocol compliance](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116647) for carbon and greenhouse gas accounting.
* [Scientific expertise](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IhkxW-kAAAAJ) in plant biology, soil science, carbon cycling, ecology.
* Data science and statistics, with a specialty in sparse, messy, or strangely distributed datasets.
* Numerical modeling of complex biological systems, with emphasis on reproducible and auditable answers to real-world questions.
* [Programming](https://github.com/infotroph) in R, Python, bash, C++, Stan, PostgreSQL, and others.
* Project management and quality assurance: Testing, continuous integration, Git,  GitHub, package development, scientific and technical writing.

## Experience

### Senior Scientist, Indigo Ag (2020-2024)

* Lead scientist for model calibration and validation of DayCent-CR for carbon crediting under Climate Action Reserve's Soil Enrichment Protocol.
* Lead author of two model validation reports, co-lead author of journal article describing validation process, co-inventor on three granted and five pending patents.
* Specified and built multi-language (R, Python, bash) pipelines for reproducible model validation.
* Ensured compliance of model calibration, validation, and deployment with protocol requirements.
* Responsible for collecting, organizing, and updating datasets collected from scientific literature for use in model validation


### Owner, CK Black Science Consulting (2020-2022)

* Provided advice on selection and validation of biogeochemical models for use in carbon crediting.
* Coordinated review of and data extraction from scientific literature to address client business needs.
* Maintained and upgraded legacy scientific software to meet modern development standards.
* Mentor and organization administrator for students participating in Google's Summer of Code.


### Postdoctoral Scholar, Pennsylvania State University, 2017-2020

* Designed and carried out research on how plant roots grow through hard soil.
* Developed soil physics module for a numerical simulator of plant root growth (C++).
* Conceptualized, implemented, and documented run management tools for suites of HPC-based plant growth simulations (R, bash).
* Collected, cleaned, and used experimental data to generate models of root growth.
* Presented research at four international scientific conferences and one invited seminar.


### Programmer, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, 2017-2018

* Developed script interfaces and API wrappers for an ecoinformatics modeling platform (R, PostgreSQL).

* Coordinated with globally distributed team to deliver timely code review and patches (GitHub, Slack).
* Point person for questions about best practices in R package development and testing.
<!-- * Once introduced as "Our code wizard who appears out of the Internet and fixes our problems." -->


### PhD student, University of Illinois, 2009-2016

* Designed and carried out research on how plants and soil respond to climate change.
* Developed novel statistical models to estimate root biomass from sparse, noisy data (R, Python, Stan).
* Four publications in refereed journals, two as lead author.
* Oral or poster presentations at six scientific meetings with >3000 attendees.
* Lectured, supervised labs and field research, and evaluated writing of undergraduate students.
* Supervised groups of 1-5 research assistants.
* Maintained electrical, electronic, and mechanical infrastructure of an outdoor experimental facility.


### Web Developer, Reed College, 2004-2007
