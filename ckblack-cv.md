## Education
Ph.D. in progress, Plant Biology. University of Illinois, completion expected 2016.

B.A., Biology. Reed College 2008.

## What I Do
Ecophysiology, biogeochemistry, and global change ecology of belowground interactions between plants and their environment. Special skills in stable isotope methods and reproducible data analysis. Less special skill: very good at digging holes.
