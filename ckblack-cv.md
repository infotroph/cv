## Education
Ph.D., Plant Biology. University of Illinois 2016.

B.A., Biology. Reed College 2008.

## What I Do
Modeling, data wrangling, and biology. Research interests in ecophysiology, biogeochemistry, and global change ecology of belowground interactions between plants and their environment. Special skills in Bayesian statistics, reproducible data analysis, and programming for high-performance computing environments. Less special skill: very good at digging holes.
