## What I Do

Modeling, data wrangling, and biology. Research interests in ecophysiology, biogeochemistry, and global change ecology of belowground interactions between plants and their environment. Special skills in Bayesian statistics, reproducible data analysis, R and C++  application development, and programming for high-performance computing environments. Less special skill: very good at digging holes.


## Education

Ph.D., Plant Biology. University of Illinois 2016.

B.A., Biology. Reed College 2008.
